    "text": " And how do Russians perceive Putin as of now? So, first I will tell you how I perceive Putin. And then I will tell you how Russians perceive Putin. For me, Putin is a very astute leader. A very astute statesman. Explain. So, again, Western media would paint Putin as a dictator. You know, that he is the one who rules. He tells what has to happen. You can't do this in Russia. You can't do that in Russia. Yes, there are some things you can't do. But on the global stage, Putin brings about democracy. Because if Russia was not led by a strong leader like Vladimir Putin, And if it was a weak leader, like the US, who would say, Yes, we are listening to you. We will do what you say. So, on the global stage, the same monopoly of the West is going away. But he resists. He is a man who will do what he wants to do. So, on the global stage, he is bringing about democracy. He is bringing about equality. He is bringing about a world where there is a multipolarity. Not just one narrative, not just one dollar, Ruble will also work. Of course, it will cause problems. So, I think Putin is a very, very smart astute. How do Russians perceive Putin? In all of the gatherings where I have gone, Where Putin comes, the kind of welcome he gets, you know. Putin waits, like I told you. He makes you wait. You wait and wait without any complaint. One hour, two hours. Why? Mind game, power game. You know, you can call it whatever you want. But, I mean, I think there was this very famous story that Putin also made the queen wait once. So, he doesn't care. He doesn't. Why doesn't he do so? Power game. I wouldn't know. I wouldn't know. It's like you wait for me. So, you should know I am important. I think he is beyond that. The moment he comes, people are standing. They are giving him a standing ovation. They are clapping. And the energy in that space, it changes. The way he walks in, the way he addresses the public. And then after a while, people just like start clapping. Like a little too much. He says, stop it. Let me finish. So, he is an enigma. But is it fear or respect? It's respect. Why? How? Why not? Don't people get scared a lot? Okay, he is coming. So, probably some people have also accepted that he will stay here. For sure, he has been here for many years. And he will stay here for many years. That's what one can imagine. But what he has done for Russia, he has done a lot. So, people are also thankful for that. If you go to Moscow today, and I have travelled a lot in European countries, and a lot of beautiful European cities. I think Moscow is stunning. And it's so much more cleaner than so many other parts of the world. And it's got so much mystery to it. Because not so many people go there. People go to Paris and their money is also taken away. There is also a lot of buglery and loot. But, you know, so, so, Russia has really risen in that sense. And the pushback that has been done, you know, like for Russia, it's important to be, they are nationalists, you know. So, they like him. They love him. They love him. Are they too dependent on him? Russia is too dependent on Putin? Like what after him? Yeah, so that's a very, very good question. And I asked that question to somebody when I was in Russia the last time. And the answer that I got, and the answer that I will give you now is that, good leaders, they never reveal their cards. So, I'm pretty sure that he has a plan, what after him. Because he loves Russia. And he will not leave Russia in just any random hands. I'm sure he's got a plan sorted out. But we would never know that plan till we have to know that plan. How strong is Russia today after two years of global sanctions? It's very interesting. When you go to Russia, especially after the war, people have a perception that the war would have disrupted everything. The war would have sort of disrupted, not just the economy, but the very fabric of how people are sort of living there. But what has happened after the sanctions? A lot of companies pulled out. So, a lot of companies pulled out. But the infrastructure, and I'm giving you a very vague, very loosely I'm giving you an example of McDonald's. But they left the infrastructure of McDonald's. They left. McDonald's is running. The same burgers are being made there. The name of McDonald's has changed. But the money is now staying within Russia. There's no money which is going back to the McDonald's guys. So, who's running it? Russians. So, someone took it in Russia, made it a restaurant, and let's say McDonald's is running it. Exactly. And the money for McDonald's is coming to Russia. Because first, a part of that money would go back to the guys who owned McDonald's. Right? So, the burger is as tasty or as whatever, like not tasty. But it's the same thing. So, this is happening with everything there. That's how the countries get strengthened. That where there's more money, we sell goods to those countries from our country. So that we make money. Now, these people are not able to sell anywhere. So, how much will be the internal consumption? So, overall, there must be a difference in the economy somewhere. It's not like the economy is not making any difference. So, this is the reason why the West is also trying to sanction Russia as much as possible. Whether it's oil, you know, and they're doing it in a roundabout way. Everyone is buying it. They're buying oil, they're buying gas. You tell India not to buy oil. But you're buying oil yourself. From Russia. Of course, they're buying oil. But they try to put these caps. That you shouldn't buy this much, you shouldn't buy that much. It can't be according to your convenience. Now, a new set of sanctions have also come. On two of Russia's biggest oil companies, Lukoil and Rosneft. And there are like lots of reports happening now. Will India be able to buy oil or not? But there are always like these loopholes in the system, right? Because if you sanction a company, then the company will give it to someone else. You will buy oil from somewhere else. Something will happen. So, in my understanding, they're trying to find ways of still procuring. Because there are no other options for India. You have Venezuela, France, you have everything. You can buy from anywhere in India. You don't tell India not to buy from there. In Europe, winter becomes cold winters. So, you have to buy it too. But you can't say, you buy this much and you don't buy that much. And then once the oil comes to India, for example. India is refining that oil. And India is selling it to the US and to everybody else. Because once the oil is refined, then that Russian oil is not left. Oil is oil. So, the sanctions haven't worked. It's a reality. The sanctions have not worked in Russia. And they've not had the kind of impact that they thought it will have in the Russian economy. And it is because of India. A large part of it. Well, for sure. And that's why I said that, you know, this is almost like a revival of the... We buy it. We buy a lot of oil. We have been clear. We are like national interest first. Everything else later. For sure. Then we send it to the world. And that's why the US-India is also happening. For sure. Also, when India was supposed to buy oil in the beginning. You took Russia out of the international financial system. Of the traditional way of doing payments. So, when you took it out of the international system. They thought that transactions will not be possible. How will you change the currency? What will happen? But... Rupee-Ruble? Trade started. And that became such a trend now. That so many countries now are talking about trading in local currencies. So many countries are now trading in local currencies. India is trading not just with Russia and local currencies. But other countries as well. What is happening with that? De-dollarization. So, those sanctions are on their head. And have they become more dangerous now after this war on Ukraine? Who has become more dangerous? Russia. Dangerous to who? The world? Ukraine? Who? Just dangerous to the world and in themselves. That we can fight and we will be unapologetic about it. Now nobody can do anything about it. The more the globe will put sanctions on us. We will find ways to get out of it. So, it can also make them unapologetic. There can be two ways. One is that internally they are bleeding. And they just want a way out. That they will salt from somewhere. So that once it is salted, they will never do it again. So, they might be weaker from inside. But what you are telling, it looks like they have gotten stronger. The economy has improved. Relationships have improved. Plus, the courage that the Russians will celebrate. Probably, that we can do anything. We can be unapologetic about it. So, that makes them dangerous. They are not thinking about what are going to be the global consequences. We can do whatever. But nobody wants a war. Does Russia want a war? No. It was a war that was inflicted on Russia. You are being poked. You are being warned. You are being warned. Don't poke us. In this time, in today's date. When the world has progressed so much. Why do you need a military alliance? Why do you need a NATO? And your neighbor is saying that we are joining NATO. So, Russia does not want the war. The war has really prolonged now. The hope is that it stops at some point. Trump is trying his little trick there as well. As he says that he wants to stop all wars in the world. But if the war stops. Of course, Russia will benefit from it. Whatever it is, there is a loss. There is a huge loss. And if you keep economy aside. People are dying. Nobody wants that for their people. Russia loves their people. Russia loves Russians. Look at the population dynamics there. And they want Russians. So, What do you think? I don't know if they have gotten weaker or dangerous. I wouldn't say they have gotten dangerous. But have they gotten weaker then? They are sustaining. They are sustaining the war. Are they self-sufficient? Or are they dependent silently on India and China? Every country is dependent on some country or the other. If you are talking trade here. Just in order to save the economy. Are they dependent too much on China and India? For example, India. When India had border clashes with China. India was still doing trade with China. So, trade will happen. So, I mean of course. If that's dependence. Then that's trade. But if you are talking trade. So, I mean of course. If that's dependence. Then that's dependence. Of course, Russia is doing trade. For example, India imports about 40% of its defence. Its arms. Defence needs from Russia. And, But that's been happening since forever. If you are in good defence. Then people will want to buy. But if you see. Then India is also getting help. Like the S-400 for example. During the conflict in Kashmir. It came in very handy. So, it's a transaction. Of course, it needs partners. And of course, they are not able to trade with some people. And of course, they are not able to trade with some people. So, by default then. Their east reach out. India, China, Africa as well. So, yeah. If you call that dependence. Then you may. Thank you so much for watching this clip till the end. If you want to watch more such clips.
